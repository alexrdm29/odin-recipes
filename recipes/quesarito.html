        <h2>Instructions:</h2>

            <h3>Tortilla:</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>In a bowl, add flour, baking powder, and salt; whisk together until thoroughly combined. </li>
                    <li>Combine water and oil in a separate container. Then while constantly stirring your dry mixture with a fork, stream your oil mixture. </li>
                    <li>Once it forms a shaggy dough, begin kneading that filler to get a soft, smooth dough, about five minutes. Cover with greased plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Remove plastic wrap and divide it into five even pieces. Roll those into rough balls, lightly flour one of your balls, flatten it into a disc, and then roll it out until you get a circle of about 13 inches or more. </li>
                    <li>Heat a large pan or a griddle, place your tortilla, once it begins to bubble up and get some color, about 15 seconds, flip it and cook again for another 15 to 20 seconds. </li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Cilantro Rice:</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Wash your rice until the water runs clear; place it in a rice cooker with equal parts water, close the lid and turn it on. Once cooked, fluff it and immediately add lime zest, butter, and cilantro. Mix until the butter melted and incorporated in the rice</li>
                    <li>Season your rice to taste with lime juice and salt. </li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Chipotle Sauce:</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Add chiles in adobo, garlic, and hot sauce; blend until smooth. In a medium-size bowl, add mayonnaise, all the chipotle puree, salt to taste, and whisk together until thoroughly combined. </li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Nacho Cheese:</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>In a saucepan, add butter, heat over medium heat until melted; then add flour, whisk that together and cook while constantly stirring for about 45 seconds. Then whisk in cayenne powder, let it toast for 15 seconds, and add milk. If it gets too thick, add a little bit more milk. </li>
                    <li>Once that’s hot and begin to bubble, stir in cheddar, let it melt completely, and then add American cheese.</li>
                    <li>Stir until completely melted; season with salt if needed.</li>
                    <li>Set it aside and keep warm. </li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Assembling:</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Lay down a tortilla, spread enough grated cheddar to create a thin layer of cheese. </li>
                    <li>Drizzle that with your nacho cheese, another layer of grated cheddar, top that with another equal size tortilla; press that to adhere.</li>
                    <li>On the bottom third, add your cilantro rice, top the rice with more nacho cheese, add a stack of your birria beef.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle with sour cream, followed by a generous drizzle of your chipotle sauce, add cilantro leaves. Roll your burrito; make sure it’s tight and well folded. Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat with a bit of spray oil, and let your burrito sit for two to three minutes or until toasted. </li>
                    <li>With a spatula, flip and toast the other side for 2 minutes.  </li>
                </ol>
