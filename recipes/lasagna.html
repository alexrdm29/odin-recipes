    <H1>What is a Lasagna?</H1>

        <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions. </p>

    <h3>Homemade pasta method</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Add the flour to a large bowl. Create a well in the center of the flour.</li>
            <li>To the well, add in 3 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs. Whisk together using a fork. </li>
            <li>While whisking, slowly incorporate the flour into the eggs until a shaggy dough forms. </li>
            <li>Pour onto a work surface and begin kneading by hand until smooth. </li>
            <li>Wrap in plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Shape into an oval and roll it out just under ½-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Run through a pasta roller starting with the widest setting working towards the number 4 setting until the dough is ⅛-inch thick. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. </li>
            <li>Cut to line-up with a 9x13 pan then cut in half lengthwise. Should have 10-12 sheets.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Sauce method</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In a dutch oven or heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat until ripping hot. </li>
            <li>Add in the ground meat and sear for 3-4 minutes, flip and repeat on the other side for 2-3 minutes. Mash all the meat together using a potato masher until fine. Transfer to a separate container. </li>
            <li>Add more oil to the pot if needed, add in the finely sliced garlic, and reduce heat to medium. Stirring occasionally until the garlic begins to toast.</li>
            <li>Add in diced yellow onion, season to taste with salt stirring together, and saute until the onions turn translucent. </li>
            <li>Once the onions are translucent, add in fennel powder and stir together. Saute for 30 seconds. </li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and stir together. Saute until it has caramelized and sticks to the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Stir in a can of crushed tomatoes then add the meat back to the pot and stir until incorporated. </li>
            <li>Simmer and reduce for 5-7 minutes or until slightly thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Cheese mixture method</h3>
